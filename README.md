# Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
Fraud detection is a crucial problem in financial transactions, e-commerce, and other industries. This project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent transactions based on transaction data, improving security and reducing financial losses. The goal is to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate, leveraging classification models to provide high accuracy and precision.

## Problem Statement
Fraudsters are becoming more sophisticated as digital transactions increase. Detecting fraud quickly is essential to prevent financial damage. This project applies machine learning techniques to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate, enabling better risk management and customer protection.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for data manipulation, model building, and evaluation.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **scikit-learn**: For building machine learning models and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For exploration and model training.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **GitHub Actions**: For continuous integration (optional, if implemented).

## Data Description
This project uses a dataset with transaction records containing features like transaction amount, user behavior, and time of transaction. The goal is to classify each transaction as either fraudulent or legitimate. The dataset is located in the data/ folder.

train.csv: The training dataset used for model development.

test.csv: The test dataset used for model evaluation.

## How to Use
## 1. Data Preprocessing
First, preprocess the data to clean and transform it for modeling:

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/preprocess.py
## 2. Train the Model
Train the model using the provided training script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/train_model.py
## 3. Evaluate the Model
The model will be evaluated using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.

## 4. Make Predictions
Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict whether a new transaction is fraudulent:

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/train_model.py --predict
## Performance Metrics
### This model uses several evaluation metrics:

### Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.

### Precision: The percentage of correct fraud predictions out of all predicted frauds.

### Recall: The percentage of correct fraud predictions out of all actual frauds.

### F1-Score: A balance between precision and recall.
